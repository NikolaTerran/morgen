  Fri 5:09pmJerry Citron
  I will ask 3 out of the five randomly
  Question to consider for Tuesday Exam
  1.What are the immunological mechanistic differences between the four different hypersensitivity reactions ( I , II ,III, IV).
  Be able to draw models and explain each type. Provide an example for each

        hypersensitivity I:
            Allergy:
                  Fast response which occurs in minutes, rather than multiple hours or days.
                  Free antigens cross link the IgE on mast cells and basophils which causes a release of vasoactive biomolecules.
                  ---Asthma

        hypersensitivity II:
            Cytotoxic, antibody-dependent:
                  Antibody (IgM or IgG) binds to antigen on a target cell, which is actually a host cell
                  that is perceived by the immune system as foreign,
                  leading to cellular destruction via the MAC.
                  ---Grave's disease

        hypersensitivity III:
            Immune complex disease:
                  Antibody (IgG) binds to soluble antigen, forming a circulating immune complex.
                  This is often deposited in the vessel walls of the joints and kidney, initiating a local inflammatory reaction.[4]
                  ---Rheumatoid arthritis

        hypersensitivity IV:
            delayed hypersensitivity:
                  T helper cells (specifically Th1 cells) are activated by an antigen presenting cell.
                  When the antigen is presented again in the future, the memory Th1 cells will activate macrophages and cause an inflammatory response.
                  This ultimately can lead to tissue damage
                  ---Contact dermatitis


  2. Compare and constrast the following immune disorders
    0) lupus, skin rash, systematic
    1) rheumatoid arthritis, , SLE, Graves, Hashimotos, pernicious anemia, type one diabetes, myasthenia gravis, Crohn’s , multiple scherosis
    hashimotos- attack thyroid


  3. Explain what hemolytic disease of the newborn is , how is can happen and what can be done to reduce the risk for the mothers second pregnancy.
            Hemolytic disease of the newborn, also known as hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn,
                  is an alloimmune condition that develops in a peripartum fetus,
                  when the IgG molecules (one of the five main types of antibodies)
                  produced by the mother pass through the placenta. Among these antibodies
                  are some which attack antigens on the red blood cells in the fetal circulation,
                  breaking down and destroying the cells (hemolysis). The fetus can develop reticulocytosis and anemia.
                  This fetal disease ranges from mild to very severe, and fetal death from heart failure (hydrops fetalis) can occur.
                  When the disease is moderate or severe, many erythroblasts (immature red blood cells) are present in the fetal blood,
                  and so these forms of the disease can be called erythroblastosis fetalis (or erythroblastosis foetalis).
            Once a woman has antibodies, she is at high risk for a future transfusion reaction if she is in need of a blood transfusion.
                  For this reason, she must carry a medical alert card at all times and inform all doctors and emergency personnel of her antibody status.
                  The absence of antibodies however does not preclude a woman from having a transfusion reaction:
            "Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions may be either immune-mediated or nonimmune-mediated. Immune-mediated hemolytic transfusion reactions caused by immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-A, anti-B, or anti-A,B typically result in severe, potentially fatal complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis. Immune-mediated hemolytic reactions caused by IgG, Rh, Kell, Duffy, or other non-ABO antibodies typically result in extravascular sequestration, shortened survival of transfused red cells, and relatively mild clinical reactions. Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions due to immune hemolysis may occur in patients who have no antibodies detectable by routine laboratory procedures."[41]

  4) Compare and constrast the following: folliculitis, furuncle, carbuncle , erysipelas and impetigo and acne
        Folliculitis is the infection and inflammation of one or more hair follicles.
            The condition may occur anywhere on the skin except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.
            The rash may appear as pimples that come to white tips on the face, chest, back, arms, legs, buttocks, or head.
        A boil, also called a furuncle, is a deep folliculitis, infection of the hair follicle.
            It is most commonly caused by infection by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus,
            resulting in a painful swollen area on the skin caused by an accumulation of pus and dead tissue.
            Most human infections are caused by coagulase-positive S. aureus strains,
            notable for the bacteria's ability to produce coagulase, an enzyme that can clot blood.
            Almost any organ system can be infected by S. aureus.
        A carbuncle is a cluster of furuncles caused by bacterial infection,
            most commonly with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.
            The presence of a carbuncle is a sign that the immune system is active and fighting the infection.
            The infection is contagious and may spread to other areas of the body, or other people;
        Erysipelas is an acute infection typically with a skin rash, usually on any of the legs and toes, face, arms, and fingers.
            It is an infection of the upper dermis and superficial lymphatics,
            usually caused by beta-hemolytic group A Streptococcus bacteria on scratches or otherwise infected areas.
            Erysipelas is more superficial than cellulitis, and is typically more raised and demarcated.
            The term is from Greek ἐρυσίπελας, meaning "red skin".
            In animals, erysipelas is a disease caused by infection with the bacterium Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae.
            Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae can also infect humans, but in that case the infection is known as erysipeloid.
      Impetigo is a bacterial infection that involves the superficial skin.
            The most common presentation is yellowish crusts on the face, arms, or legs.
            Less commonly there may be large blisters which affect the groin or armpits.
            The lesions may be painful or itchy. Fever is uncommon.
            It is typically due to either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.[3] Risk factors include attending day care, crowding, poor nutrition, diabetes mellitus, contact sports, and breaks in the skin such as from mosquito bites, eczema, scabies, or herpes.[3][4] With contact it can spread around or between people.[3] Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and appearance.[3]
            Prevention is by hand washing, avoiding people who are infected, and cleaning injuries.[3] Treatment is typically with antibiotic creams such as mupirocin or fusidic acid.[3][5] Antibiotics by mouth, such as cephalexin, may be used if large areas are affected.[3] Antibiotic-resistant forms have been found.[3]
            Impetigo affected about 140 million people (2% of the world population) in 2010.[6] It can occur at any age, but is most common in young children.[3] In some places the condition is also known as "school sores".[1] Without treatment people typically get better within three weeks.[3] Complications may include cellulitis or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.[3] The name is from the Latin impetere meaning "attack".[7]
      Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.[10] It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring.[1][2][11] It primarily affects areas of the skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, upper part of the chest, and back.[12] The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.[3][4]

      Genetics is thought to be the primary cause of acne in 80% of cases.[2] The role of diet and cigarette smoking is unclear, and neither cleanliness nor exposure to sunlight appear to play a part.[2][13][14] In both sexes, hormones called androgens appear to be part of the underlying mechanism, by causing increased production of sebum.[5] Another frequent factor is excessive growth of the bacterium Propionibacterium acnes, which is normally present on the skin.[5]

      Many treatment options for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help.[7] Treatments applied directly to the affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used.[8] Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth for the treatment of acne.[8] However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy.[15] Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women.[8] Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects.[8][16] Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact to individuals.[4]

      In 2015, acne was estimated to affect 633 million people globally, making it the 8th most common disease worldwide.[9][17] Acne commonly occurs in adolescence and affects an estimated 80–90% of teenagers in the Western world.[18][19][20] Lower rates are reported in some rural societies.[20][21] Children and adults may also be affected before and after puberty.[22] Although acne becomes less common in adulthood, it persists in nearly half of affected people into their twenties and thirties and a smaller group continue to have difficulties into their forties.[2]
