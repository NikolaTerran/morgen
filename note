parametrix equation
	define curves

Parametric equations define curves as systems of equations in term
of a single independent variable

x = f(t)
y = f(t)

Parametric line
(x0,y0) -> (x1,y1)
x = f(t)
y = g(t)
               (x1,y1)
             /  t = 1
            /
           /  t = 0.5
(x0,t0)   /
       t = 0

Parametric Circle
(Cx,Cy),f
x = f(t)
y = g(t)

f(t) = cos(2PI * t) + Cx
g(t) = sin(2PI * t) + Cy
