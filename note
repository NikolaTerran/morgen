parametrix equation
	define curves

Parametric equations define curves as systems of equations in term
of a single independent variable

x = f(t)
y = f(t)

Parametric line
(x0,y0) -> (x1,y1)
x = f(t)
y = g(t)
               (x1,y1)
             /  t = 1
            /
           /  t = 0.5
(x0,t0)   /
       t = 0

Parametric Circle
(Cx,Cy),f
x = f(t)
y = g(t)

f(t) = cos(2PI * t) + Cx
g(t) = sin(2PI * t) + Cy


f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d:
f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c
	--slopes of tangent lines
	--rate of change
	
splines
--subset of curves
--designed so that 2 splines can be connected seamlessly
--we will only work with cubics
--we will only work with cubics
--we will work with HERMITE
  and BEZIER curves

Hermite Curves
--givens
	p0,p1,end points
	r0,r1,rate of change

	f(t) = at^3 + bt^2 + ct + d
	f'(t) = 3at^2 + 2bt + c
	f(0) = d = p0
	f'(0) = c = r0
	f(1) = a + b + c + d = p1
	f'(1) = 3a + 2b + c = r1


[0 0 0 1][a]   [	d	]   [p0]
[1 1 1 1][b] = [a+ b + c + d	] = [p1]
[0 0 1 0][c] = [	c	]   [r0]
[3 2 1 0][d] = [3a + 2b + c	]   [r1]

Bezier Curve
-defined by n+1 points where n is the degree of the curve
-linear
	pt = (1-t)p0 + tp1

t: 0 -> 1
x= axt^3 + bxt^2 + cxt + dx
y= ayt^3 + byt^2 + cyt + dy

Quadratic
Qt = (1-t)Q0 + tQ1
Q0t = (1-t)P0 + tP1 
Q1t = (1-t)P1 + tP2
