A vector has a direction and magnitude
Magnitude of a vector is 
	||A|| = sqrt(x^2 + y ^ 2 + z ^ 2);

^		
A = <  x/||A|| , y/||A|| , z/||A|| >


Finding A vector between 2 points

PQ = Q - P = <Qx - Px, Qy - Py , Qz - Pz>
QP = p - Q


dot product

A * B = AxbX + AyBy + AzBz   SCALAR
      = ||A|| ||b|| cos(theta)
      If A and B are normalized
      = cos(theta)
      
Cross product

A x B = <AyBz - AzBy, AzBx - AxBz, AxBy - AyBx>
